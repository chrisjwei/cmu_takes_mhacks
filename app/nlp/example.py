The homeless are the man at the coat drive looking for a warm winter coat that could fit into the backpack containing all his possessions that he took to work each day. And, yes, the homeless are the man \u201cbedding down\u201d in the doorway, living on the streets for years, mentally ill and too impaired to look after his own essential needs.\n\nAll of these people have a \u201chomelessness problem.\u201d We have to find solutions for all of them. We already have one for the chronically homeless man: supportive housing of the type that organizations like mine provide. We have a solution. Now we need the city and state to work together to fund it.\n\nANN L. SHALOF\n\nInterim Executive Director\n\nNeighborhood Coalition for Shelter\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cCity Officials Reaching Out to Homeless\u201d (news article, Sept. 3):\n\nBy now, it\u2019s surely confounding that our city does not have a grasp of why people are living on our streets \u2014 and how to reach them. After more than three decades, we should certainly understand the problem.\n\nFor too long, we\u2019ve focused on individuals \u2014 and their moral failure \u2014 as the source of the problem, with many calling the folks on the street \u201cservice resistant.\u201d But structural failures, such as the absence of quality neighborhood-based health and mental health support systems, are an underlying cause of the problem.\n\nMoreover, we should also know by now that police and city outreach teams cannot lure people on the street into shelters. No, the street is not a lifestyle preference; it\u2019s because the alternative of shelter is believed to be much worse \u2014 and often is.\n\nInstead, what works is a \u201chousing first\u201d model that would completely bypass shelters and move people right from the street into apartments with intense wraparound services, particularly focusing on mental health supports.\n\nCities across the country, especially large cities like Chicago and Boston, have used this model and made great strides in reducing their street homeless population, while also finding it much more cost-effective than shelter.\n\nAnd the long-term outcomes reinforce its efficacy. When they are in permanent housing, people are more likely to adhere to medication protocols, avoid reinstitutionalization and not return to the street.\n\nSo instead of city officials out there on the street talking with homeless New Yorkers, trying to figure out why they\u2019re there, we need to rely on tested approaches that actually address homelessness.\n\nARNOLD S. COHEN\n\nPresident and Chief Executive\n\nThe Partnership for the Homeless\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nNow, decades into the homelessness \u201ccrisis,\u201d we have to come to terms with the fact that homelessness results from structural problems that require long-term solutions, not stopgap measures.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne major cause of homelessness is the eviction of New York City\u2019s lowest-income residents. Almost all landlords who bring eviction proceedings have lawyers. Yet, lacking a right to counsel, most tenants appear in court solo because they can\u2019t afford a lawyer and can\u2019t get free legal help through the city\u2019s excellent, but underresourced, legal assistance programs. Tenant protection laws and emergency programs that help pay the rent are of no avail to tenants who don\u2019t have the skills or education to navigate courts of law.\n\nA right to counsel would keep people out of the shelters and save money. Eviction is the single largest precipitating cause of entry into homeless shelters, and legal representation prevents evictions. The City Council\u2019s Finance Division has done the math: Savings from averting entries into the shelter system would exceed the cost of guaranteeing a right to counsel by more than $53 million.\n\nA bill before the City Council (and co-sponsored by 38 of the 51 council members) would guarantee a right to counsel in eviction cases. This legislation should be adopted now, not as a stopgap, but as a permanent measure that would give the poorest New Yorkers a fighting chance to stay in their homes and out of the homeless shelters.\n\nANDREW SCHERER\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is policy director of the Impact Center for Public Interest Law at New York Law School and author of \u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York.\u201d", "image": {"publisher": "New York Times", "url": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/opinion/11LhomelessWeb/11LhomelessWeb-master675.jpg", "originalContextUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/homeless-in-new-york-ways-to-help.html", "tbUrl": "http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcScveUJBh1PSK9iOgCN3AGzLm1AXC_jSTyitYTXyLc0b78--Gi4OqT_OLFW", "tbWidth": 80, "tbHeight": 51}, "publish_data": datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 11, 0, 0), "location": ", "authors": []}, "summary": ["ANN L.

Lawmakers visited the Road Home\"s Palmer Court and ate lunch with clients of Catholic Community Services of Utah.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 It\"s not often that Keith Lamb sits down to lunch with a state senator and a state representative.\n\nBut Friday, during the noon meal at Catholic Community Services of Utah\"s St. Vincent de Paul Dining Hall, Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, and Sen. Allen Christensen, R-North Odgen, were his dining companions.\n\n"It was interesting," said Lamb, who is living at the Road Home\"s downtown shelter while he recovers from surgery on both knees and he reapplies for his commercial driver license, which is expired.\n\nLamb said Spendlove and Christensen asked him if he lives in the homeless shelter, if he likes it and if he feels safe there.\n\n"It\"s good to see other people come into these places, actually eat the food and take part of the whole surroundings," Lamb said.\n\nChristensen, Spendlove and other members the Utah Legislature\"s Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee took their business on the road Friday, conducting a meeting at the Road Home\"s Palmer Court.\n\n"We study these issues every day in our committees and in our work. I was able to meet several children that are in the Head Start program and have lunch with a man who is down on his luck living in the homeless shelter. Putting that face to the issue is essential," Spendlove said.\n\nSen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, said he learned more about the services offered at the Weigand Homeless Resource Center and its dining hall.\n\n"The food was good. I\"m just impressed with all the services for people who come here. I didn\"t know about the homeless court, haircuts and UTA dispute resolution," Weiler said.\n\nThomas Pavich, who shared a lunch table with Rep. Paul Ray, R-Sunset, and Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake, said he volunteers at the dining hall because "I\"ve been on both sides of the fence," referring to homelessness.\n\nPavich is no longer homeless and enjoys giving back when he can, he said. "I love everyone down here. It\"s a beautiful thing."\n\nHe also knows what it means to have a hot meal when you don\"t have a roof over your head.\n\n"I\"ve been there. Once in a while I see a couple of people I know down and out on the street and I let them come to my place to shower up and I do their laundry for them. It\"s a little thing, but a lot of the time, they don\"t have anywhere else to do it," he said.\n\nAs for spending time with state lawmakers, Pavich said he respects their gift of service.\n\n"God bless them," he said.\n\nMatthew Melville, Catholic Community Services\" operations manager for homeless services, told lawmakers that St. Vincent de Paul serves 500-600 lunches and dinners each day.\n\nRecently, volunteers and staff have observed an increase in families seeking meals at dinner time.\n\n"The other night when I was volunteering, there were five tables full of families," Melville said.\n\nAt Palmer Court, a 201-unit apartment complex for formerly chronically homeless families and individuals, lawmakers toured a studio apartment and the Head Start program on site.\n\nWhile Friday\"s visit gave lawmakers a glimpse of supportive housing and community-based services, Matthew Minkevitch, executive director of the Road Home, reminded legislators that people who no longer need shelter and services need "deeply affordable housing" to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nSome estimates suggest there is need for some 8,000 units of affordable housing in Salt Lake County alone, he said.\n\nEmail: marjorie@deseretnews.com", "image": {"publisher": "Deseret News", "url": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/midres/1595336/1595336.jpg", "originalContextUrl": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865636617/Lawmakers-get-glimpse-of-lives-of-homeless-people-services-that-help-them.html?pg=all", "tbUrl": "http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQFsJj94PU9Tsd050zE9yhugQmkv_b7DhAr9J49qskdlwEPSOqHQY6-7JM", "tbWidth": 80, "tbHeight": 57}, "publish_data": datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 11, 18, 35, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -21600)), "location": ", "authors": ["Marjorie Cortez"]}, "summary": ["While Friday\"s visit gave lawmakers a glimpse of supportive housing and community-based services, Matthew Minkevitch, executive director of the Road Home, reminded legislators that people who no longer need shelter and services need "deeply affordable housing" to achieve self-sufficiency.", "But Friday, during the noon meal at Catholic Community Services of Utah"s St. Vincent de Paul Dining Hall, Rep.

Homeless people deserve the same thing as every other human being \u2014 a place that\u2019s safe and clean and respected.\u201d The group issued a set of demands to county officials, who visited the site Friday morning. The demands include a government-sanctioned site for up to 30 homeless people to camp for as long as they\u2019d like, permission and assistance from the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors as well as the Santa Rosa City Council to recreate similar encampments in other areas within the next four months, and rescinding local laws that prohibit camping on public lands.

Epple said she and organizers with Homeless Action triggered their protest plans following an Aug. 6 memo from the U.S. Department of Justice, which contended that laws preventing homeless people from sleeping in public when there is not enough shelter space to meet the need violate the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. The memo stemmed from an Idaho court case in which the federal government sided with plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the city of Boise who were convicted under laws there that criminalize sleeping or camping in public. \u201cMaking it a crime for people who are homeless to sleep in public spaces when there is insufficient shelter space in a city unconstitutionally punishes them for being homeless,\u201d Department of Justice officials said in a written statement. Sonoma County Supervisor Efren Carrillo, whose district includes the Santa Rosa encampment, said he is considering offering the group an alternative location to set up camp, an option which Epple said she would consider. County officials are eager to clear the encampment from the property so they can sell it to a developer. It went on the market last week and is zoned for high-density housing, of which at least 15 percent must be affordable. Meanwhile, Epple said, another wave of homeless people are seeking to move in to the camp. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting down the road at the Finley Center to see if we get cleared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut so far, the county is willing to negotiate with us.\u201d You can reach Staff Writer Angela Hart at 526-8503 or angela.hart@pressdemocrat.com.

(Denver Post file)\n\nThe Ballpark Neighborhood Association has been criticized for its lawsuit that resulted in a recent court reversal of a zoning appeals board decision regarding a homeless "community center" in Denver\"s Lower Downtown. We\"ve been accused of seeking to deny services to the homeless and of having a NIMBY (not in my backyard) mentality.\n\nTo the contrary. The critics clearly aren\"t aware of the multiple missions and other services in our neighborhood that already serve the largest concentration of homeless in the metro area.\n\nIs NIMBYism a fair characterization of a neighborhood group that is not at all opposed to a Colorado Coalition for the Homeless project, in our neighborhood, that will provide supportive housing for 100 people, a much more effective and, from the taxpayers\" perspective, efficient solution?\n\nAs to the argument that the ruling will delay services to the homeless, and that failing to complete the center adjacent to the Denver Rescue Mission would be a waste of money, what is the price of a governing board\"s, in the court\"s words, "arbitrary and capricious ... abuse of power"? Shouldn\"t a city-financed project follow the same rules as those required of private businesses and landowners?\n\nMonths ago, the city and the mission were advised that they were proceeding with construction at their own risk because of the questionable \u2014 now illegal \u2014 zoning decision, but they went ahead anyway. The risk was theirs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mission is our neighbor. It provides valuable services, including supportive housing at one of its locations. The facility expansion \u2014 a larger kitchen, restrooms and washers and dryers \u2014 will provide some needed services. But the $9.5 million spent on it could have leveraged hundreds of supportive housing units.\n\nThe mayor has made affordable housing one of his goals, as is appropriate for a city that is gradually pushing the working class out to the suburbs. The homeless shouldn\"t be left out of the equation.\n\nWhat\"s needed are services dispersed throughout the city, an approach the homeless want. What\"s needed is city and non-profit service providers talking to each other, coordinating their plans, and working together, something that is not happening now. What\"s needed is a better understanding of the homeless themselves, their needs for such things as storage space for their minimal belongings (not provided in the Lawrence facility), adequate laundry and 24/7 hygiene services (also not provided by the center). I know the homeless want those things because they tell me.\n\nThe Ballpark Neighborhood Association respects the homeless who are on our streets. They are our neighbors and, in many cases, friends. Let\"s work together to come up with the most efficient and most effective long-term solutions to get them better places to live than the street.

A Home For Every Veteran, a spin-off effort to the regional partnership aimed at reducing homelessness, has housed about 430 homeless vets but roughly another 260 are left, Kafoury said.\n\n"We\"re knocking on doors. We\"re calling landlords. We are finding apartments for you," Kafoury told the veterans.\n\nThe effort needs more landlords who are willing to rent out their spaces to veterans, she said. Even if the effort succeeds in finding homes for almost 700 veterans, homelessness won\"t truly end, Kafoury acknowledged after her speech.\n\n"People are still going to become homeless," she said. "New veterans are going to return from being deployed or people who have housing now are going to lose it. We have built a response system. We are going to have everything in place."\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Glover, veterans services director at Transition Projects Inc., a nonprofit that works with homeless men and women, was the man in charge of Friday\"s Stand Down. Transition Projects has led the event for three years, but it\"s been around for more than a decade, he said.\n\nNew at this year\"s event: a Multnomah County Circuit Court judge and district attorney helped homeless vets expunge tickets and misdemeanor warrants in exchange for community service, Glover said.\n\n"That\"s a huge barrier to people\"s housing: the legal issues," said Glover, who was in charge of finding some service work for veterans, such as trash pick up or sweeping hair from the event\"s four barber chairs.\n\nVeterans were even getting some free tools.\n\nLake Oswego-based Tools 4 Troops brought 700 to 800 refurbished tools, such as hammers, saws, levels and power drills -- all for free. By 2:30 p.m., just about everything, an estimated $6,500 worth of tools, had been given away, said Pete Wall, the organization\"s president.\n\n"A lot of these vets live and work out of their trucks, and their tools get stolen," Wall. "So we\"ll supply them with stuff like an electrical set. We\"ve done that dozens of times, probably two or three times a week."\n\n-- Tony Hernandez\n\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n\n503-294-5928\n\n@tonyhreports", "image": {"publisher": "OregonLive.com", "url": "http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width960/img/oregonian/photo/2015/09/11/portland-veterans-stand-down-2015-c3ba123965728a01.jpg", "originalContextUrl": "http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/09/at_veterans_stand_down_oregon.html", "tbUrl": "http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJZ2l4P_ICqixvQotqN4JL70jXAr-kgH7XA4EqDswRb3ZofEB3hMQY4zo", "tbWidth": 80, "tbHeight": 53}, "publish_data": datetime.datetime(2015, 9, 11, 18, 20), "location": ", "authors": ["Tony Hernandez", "The Oregonian Oregonlive"]}, "summary": [""That\"s a huge barrier to people\"s housing: the legal issues," said Glover, who was in charge of finding some service work for veterans, such as trash pick up or sweeping hair from the event\"s four barber chairs.", "New at this year"s event: a Multnomah County Circuit Court judge and district attorney helped homeless vets expunge tickets and misdemeanor warrants in exchange for community service, Glover said."]}, {"keywords": ["thursday night", "virginia villarreal", "death\n\nreports", "sack lunch", "martinez creek", "special mass"], "article": {"language": "en", "title": "Parish mourns death of homeless man swept away by high water", "url": "http://www.kens5.com/story/news/2015/09/11/parish-mourns-death--homeless-man-swept-away--high-water/72120408/", "text": "St. Ann\"s Parish (Photo: KENS 5)\n\nA man\"s body was found Friday afternoon just north of downtown, according to the San Antonio Fire Department.\n\nAround 1:15 , crews pulled the body from Martinez Creek.

The man walked in a turn lane trying to avoid lunch hour traffic, shuffling his way toward Clemson Boulevard.\n\nOn Friday night, more than 100 volunteers got a glimpse of what that man and others like him experience every day. The volunteers built a \u201cbox city\u201d at the William A. Floyd Amphitheater on the grounds of the Anderson Sports and Entertainment Center. They planned to stay overnight to experience homelessness for themselves.\n\nThey participated in \u201cHomeless for the Homeless,\u201d an overnight event to benefit Family Promise of Anderson County. The charity focuses on helping homeless families, and hoped to raise $6,000 by Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes people don\u2019t realize how many homeless children and families are in Anderson County,\u201d said Yolanda Archuletta, the executive director of the local Family Promise chapter. \u201cBeing homeless, in our definition, is about more than living in your car or living under an overpass. It is about not having a permanent residence, not having a home that you pay rent for or that you own. It\u2019s doubling up with an aunt or an uncle or a friend because you don\u2019t have anywhere to stay, but also understanding that you have no guarantees of staying there permanently.\u201d\n\nArchuletta said that data supplied by local school districts indicate that as many as 800 children in Anderson County may be classified as homeless, lacking a permanent residence.\n\nJonelle Herbert turned to Family Promise a few years ago. Her son was about 5 years old at the time. His father had just died, she said.\n\n\u201cMy son told his teacher that we were staying with some people and that we didn\u2019t have a house,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cShe sent home a note asking if she could help. I was embarrassed. But ultimately, asking for help and getting referred to Family Promise was the best thing that could have happened to us.\u201d\n\nNow, Herbert serves on the charity\u2019s board of directors.\n\nFamily Promise coordinates with faith-based congregations that provide rooms for overnight stays for families. The charity also works with volunteers to prepare and share food and other essentials with those families. Workers also help families with things such as setting goals and budgeting their money.\n\n\u201cWe really depend on our churches and faith communities,\u201d Archuletta said. \u201cWe could not do what we do without them.\u201d\n\nAs Friday\u2019s event reached full swing, Kaelyn Howard, a 10th-grader at T.L. Hanna High School, worked alongside her younger sisters, Cadence and McKenna. The Howard sisters were preparing the large cardboard box that would be their house for the night.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see what it would be like to be homeless for the night,\u201d Kaelyn said.\n\nCadence added spray paint to the exterior of the \u201chouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we can help someone else by being out here tonight,\u201dshe said. \u201cI really hope so.\u201d\n\nFollow Nikie Mayo on Twitter @NikieMayo", "image": {"publisher": "Anderson Independent Mail", "url": "http://mediaassets.independentmail.com/photo/2015/09/11/Box_City_001_23858192_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "originalContextUrl": "http://www.independentmail.com/news/volunteers-get-glimpse-into-being-homeless_00564567", "tbUrl": "http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWAHG0g9Pp9e2hsSgKnXoKtB04i67lfzq8xf-2dimt90AuNt7jQssAH-o", "tbWidth": 80, "tbHeight": 54}, "publish_data": None, "location": ", "authors": ["Ken Ruinard", "Nikie Mayo"]}, "summary": ["I think sometimes people dont realize how many homeless children and families are in Anderson County, said Yolanda Archuletta, the executive director of the local Family Promise chapter.", "Archuletta said that data supplied by local school districts indicate that as many as 800 children in Anderson County may be classified as homeless, lacking a permanent residence."]}]}
